Installation Instructions for Ondex Web
=======================================

Ondex Web is a Java applet and requires Oracle Java 6 browser plugin installed on your system.

1. Required files

Ondex Web is packaged in two separate files, one containing the Java code and libraries and 
a second containing a template directory structure and configuration files.

The latest Java code and libraries archive is available at:
http://ondex.rothamsted.ac.uk/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=net.sourceforge.ondex.apps&a=ovtk2lite&v=0.5.0-SNAPSHOT&e=zip&c=packaged-distro

The latest template directory structure and configuration archive is available at:
http://ondex.rothamsted.ac.uk/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=net.sourceforge.ondex.apps&a=ovtk2lite&v=0.5.0-SNAPSHOT&e=zip&c=packaged-data 

2. Installation

Ondex Web can be installed like any simple web page in a web directory accessible of any common web server.

You will need to extract the two archives mentioned in the previous section, for example by using the command
[user@host applet]# unzip ovtk2lite-0.5.0-[TIMESTAMP]-[BUILD]-packaged-distro.zip
[user@host applet]# unzip ovtk2lite-0.5.0-[TIMESTAMP]-[BUILD]-packaged-data.zip
(replace TIMESTAMP and BUILD accordingly)

Next, you need to edit the index.html in the directory you have extracted the two archives.
Within the index.html please replace all occurrences of http://ondex.rothamsted.ac.uk/applet 
with the correct URL of your server and web directory.

You should now be able to test your Ondex Web installation by opening your URL in a browser.
This will load a small example, which is shipped with Ondex Web.

3. Customization

Ondex Web offers certain options to define what file to load and the initial look of the graph.
Below you will find a list of options, only two (ondex.dir and ovtk.dir) are required, all others are optional.

General REQUIRED:
ondex.dir 	(might use relative path "data")
ovtk.dir	(might use relative path "config")

Loading from file OPTIONAL:
filename 	(path to OXL file, has to be reachable from Applet, please pay attention to java.policy.applet)
xgmml		(path to XGMML file, same conditions as above)

Loading from webservice OPTIONAL:
webservice 	(URL of webservice, e.g. http://rpc274.cs.man.ac.uk:8080/ondex/services/ondex-graph?wsdl)
graphname	(name of graph, see webservice, if multiple graphs have same name, selection is arbitrary)

Other optional parameters:
nodes.labels	(true/false show node labels)
edges.labels	(true/false show edge labels)
antialiased		(true/false use antialiased painting)
layout			(default: "net.sourceforge.ondex.ovtk2.layout.GEMLayout")
loadappearance  (true/false to load saved appearance)

4. Usage

Once Ondex Web has finished loading you can use the following keyboard short-cuts and
mouse functions to navigate and interact with the graph. Further functionality is available
via the Ondex Web menu bar.

Key bindings:
CTRL+c = center graph to fit into display
CTRL+m = special function for QTLNetMiner, load appearance and size
CTRL+z = undo last visibility change
CTRL+y = redo last visibility change
CTRL+a = select all nodes
CTRL+h = hide selection
CTRL+g = hide everything but selection
Numpad - = zoom out
Numpad + = zoom in
