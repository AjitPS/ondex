<h1>Using the OndexWeb</h1>
<div id="accFAQ">
	<h2>Why is OndexWeb not loading?</h2>
	<div>
		There are several reason why the plugin will not start, all to do with
		the Java plugin on your computer: <br /> <b>Java plug-in needs
			permission</b> If you see a message bar within Chrome that says <strong>The
			Java plug-in needs your permission to run.</strong>, you can perform
		one of the following actions:
	
	
	<ul>
		<li>Click the <strong>Run this time button</strong> to allow the Java
			content on the page to run only until you leave this page.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Always run on this site</strong> to allow Java to
			run on all this site's pages. You will not see this message again for
			pages on this site.</li>

	</ul>

	<br /> <b>Note</b>: If you are <a href="/en/download/"> downloading
		Java within Chrome</a> and this message is shown, we recommend
	clicking the <strong>Always run on this site</strong> button. <br /> <b>Additional
		plug-in required</b>: If you see a message bar within Chrome that says
	<strong>An additional plug-in is required to display some elements on
		this page</strong>, click on the <strong>Install plug-in</strong> link
	in the Chrome message bar, or download from <a href="/getjava/">java.com</a>.

	<br /> <b>Plug-in out of date</b> If you see a message bar within
	Chrome that says <strong>Plug-in out of date</strong>, click on the <strong>Update
		plug-in</strong> link in the Chrome message bar to get the latest
	Java.

<h2>Why does it take so long to load a network?</h2>
<div>
Currently the size of the Ondex Web applet is rather large (90 Mb) due to high number of dependencies that are shipped
with Ondex Web. Using Ondex Web for the first time will download and cache all dependencies which can take uo to 
3 minutes depending on your internet connection. Subsequent use of Ondex Web will be significantly faster (<20 seconds 
to load a network). We are currently working on reducing the number of dependecies.
</div>
<h2>How is Ondex Web different from Cytoscape Web?</h2>
<div>
Cytscape Web is a Flash-based network visualisation tool. Ondex Web was developed with the idea in mind to make biological 
networks that were created using the free Ondex data integration platform (www.ondex.org) available in the Web. Compared to Cytoscape networks 
are Ondex networks semantically very rich and can therefore be visualised and explored differently.
</div>
<h2>Which network formats can be visualised in Ondex Web?</h2>
<div>
Ondex Web has direct support for loading data in common network formats such as XGMML (Punin and Krishnamoorthy, 2001), 
NWB (Team, 2006), Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar, 2002) and OXL (Taubert, et al., 2007). Furthermore, the Ondex desktop 
application (www.ondex.org) can be utilized to prepare integrated datasets from a large range of sources and input formats 
(see http://ondex.org/formats.html) for use in Ondex Web. Example data sets are available for download 
(http://ondex.org/doc.html)</div>
