This document describes the steps that have to be done manually to keep the WS up to date with the rest of the code.

1. Build Ondex at least up to Webservices.
    a. Delete any methods in any auto generated classes XXXAuto.java that cause compile errors.
2. Install Webservice on a Server.
    a. Done by installing the war in webservices-server
        ii. May required removing a previous instalation
    b. Documentation here assumes war has been renamed ondex.war
3. Get ONDEXapiWS.xml and put it in WS client
    a. Found at http://localhost:8080/ondex/services/ONDEXapiWS?wsdl 
        i. ":8080" bit is server dependent
    b. May appear different to svn even if not due to non consistent ordering of elements.
    c. Rebuild the client.
4. Build WS_Test_Client - In Webservices directory
    a. May needed Editting of the POM
        i. Current version has Christian's test server hard coded in
            A. Could be replaced with different server
            B. Could be replaced with saved WSDLs but then these have to be saved manually
    b. If server dependent the server must be available.
    c. Not currently part of Hudson build due to dependence on outside server
5. Build WS_AuotCreator - In Webservices directory
    a. Depends on WS_TEST_Client so currently not part of Hudson build.
6. Run AutoMaker.java
    a. May need editing due to hard coded in.
         i. Path where code is to be written
         ii. Server name
         iii. Ondex server name
7. Rebuild Webservice Server
8. Redeploy war
